    <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <br>
    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting strutural semantics for text such as <b><em>headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</em></b> <br>
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, Written using <u>angle brackets.</u> Tags such as <code style="color: chartreuse;">&lt;img/&gt;</code> and <code style="color: chartreuse;">&lt;input/&gt;</code> directly introduce content into the page. <br>
    Other tags such as <code style="color: chartreuse;">&lt;p&gt;</code> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. <br>
    Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use then to interpret the content of the page.
